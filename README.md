# Rakib-MMMM-College
Rakib MMMM College is going to launch its dynamic website and application software to facilitate education and other services to its teachers and students. Information and communication technology has brought about a revolutionary change in all sectors worldwide including education. ICT makes a nation radically changed for the better. Nations fail to avail this opportunity is sure to lag behind. The present government led by the Honourable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is committed to reaching ICT facilities to all citizens of the nation to make a Digital Bangladesh to materialise her Vision 2021. Already Ghior Govt. College has inaugurated Multimedia Class room facilities to all departments. The launch of this dynamic website and application software, therefore, is a step to the right direction to let the world know this renowned institution of South Asia. It is sure that this endeavour to step into the ICT world will make the college a better seat of education. I hope the dynamic website and application software of this college, committed to the promotion of academic achievement and excellence, will meet all essential needs of the students and teachers.I sincerely thank the Principal of Ghior Govt. College for taking such an initiative to make this institution a digital one. I also thank you all who worked hard to make this project a success.
